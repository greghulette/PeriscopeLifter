# PeriscopeLifter
Here are the files for the PCBs that I modified for the Open Source Periscope Lifter.  All these files were created with KiCad so you may need to download them if you want to open them, or there is a Gerber folder that you can use to have them manufactured.   

The Lifter board is a slightly modified PCB from the original one.  I had added some 5V outputs and a serial port header.  Mimir has since incorporated these into his designs.  You may use this PCB or his, providing his is utilizing the Silicone Ribbon cable.  They both perform the same function.   

The Rotary PCB is a new form factor that was desiged to work with this design.
